- Weight: 1
- Project duration: Dec 7, 2023 6:00 AM to Dec 8, 2023 6:00 AM

## Concepts
- **Data Structures**
  - When and why using linked lists vs arrays
  - How to build and use linked lists

## Resources
- Read or watch:
  - Linked Lists
  - Google
  - Youtube

## Learning Objectives
- At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
  - General understanding of linked lists
  - Implementation of linked lists in C programming

## Quiz Questions
- Great! You've completed the quiz successfully! Keep going!

## Tasks

1. **Print list**
    - Write a function that prints all the elements of a list_t list.
    - Prototype: `size_t print_list(const list_t *h);`
    - Return: the number of nodes
    - Format: see example

2. **List length**
    - Write a function that returns the number of elements in a linked list_t list.
    - Prototype: `size_t list_len(const list_t *h);`

3. **Add node**
    - Write a function that adds a new node at the beginning of a list_t list.
    - Prototype: `list_t *add_node(list_t **head, const char *str);`
    - Return: the address of the new element, or NULL if it failed

4. **Add node at the end**
    - Write a function that adds a new node at the end of a list_t list.
    - Prototype: `list_t *add_node_end(list_t **head, const char *str);`
    - Return: the address of the new element, or NULL if it failed

5. **Free list**
    - Write a function that frees a list_t list.
    - Prototype: `void free_list(list_t *head);`

6. **The Hare and the Tortoise**
    - Write a function that prints a message before the main function is executed.
    - You are allowed to use the printf function

7. **Real programmers can write assembly code in any language**
    - Write a 64-bit program in assembly that prints Hello, Holberton, followed by a new line.
    - You are only allowed to use the printf function
    - You are not allowed to use interrupts

## Requirements
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc
- All your files should end with a new line
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
- Your code should use the Betty style
- You are not allowed to use global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- The only C standard library functions allowed are malloc, free and exit
- You are allowed to use _putchar
- Don’t forget to push your header file
- All your header files should be include guarded
- Please use the provided data structure for this project
